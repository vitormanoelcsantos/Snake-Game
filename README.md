# Snake-Game

I developed this game during Bootcamp HTML Web Developer together with Gabriela. [Gabriela's snake game repository](https://github.com/SpruceGabriela/snake-the-game). All the visual part with the exception of the game itself, was developed by me as well as the data consumption through the API (The API was developed by [Carlos Henrique Dias Ribeiro](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chdribeiro/)).
Technologies used for the development of the project:
- HTML5, 
- CSS3,
- JavaScript
- Fetch API

The game can be accessed through the link: [Snake Game](https://vitormanoelcsantos.github.io/Snake-Game/)
